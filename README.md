## Challenges
I ran into a challenge at the very beginning of the project: understanding pathing with Express. I needed to complete my understanding of the usage of path.join and the meaning of __dirname, which required deep reading into documentation of the package. On completion I was able to successfully link the frontend content to the server.

After conquering that challenge, I was then faced with another issue of the style.css not being able to load due to some MIME type error. I was able to do some research around the web to figure out why it was doing that. After coming to a set conclusion, I was able to change the path of the style.css to be able to load.

I think this was a challenging app to build but overall very information and worth my time. I learned a lot while building this application that I will use in other applications with the same requirements/build.
